    <p>
        1.Space tourism will increase the commercial activity in the time of poor state of world economy. Space tourism will become a new area of commercial endeavour and give employment to thousands of people. 
    </p>
    <p>2.Manufacturing of new and better spacecraft will give employment to many skilled people.It will renew interest in space exploration. As a result, there will be more financial backing to support more innovations in the industry.
    </p>
    <p>3.Another big advantage is the newsworthiness of this emerging industry. Anything that is new in this form of tourism will become news headlines. This will draw more investors making the tourism companies sustainable.

    </p>
    <p>6.Opens avenues for advanced technology which can be applied to other domains apart from space missions.
    </p>
    <p>7.Advanced opportunities in space exploration may help scientists predict earthâ€™s weather more accurately.
    </p>
    <p>8.The scientists may be able to find new minerals and other precious materials in space and other planets. This will be of great help to the people of Earth where natural resources are depleting fast.
    </p>
    <p>9.We may someday even discover life in some corner of universe, and learn from it. Exploring the space may lead to some discovery, which we cannot even imagine.
    </p>
    <p>10.Make space tourists aware of fragility of our planet. When people see Earth in dark space, and a thin layer of atmosphere they are forced to think of smallness of Earth, and it may induce us to respect our planet and preserve our natural resources.
